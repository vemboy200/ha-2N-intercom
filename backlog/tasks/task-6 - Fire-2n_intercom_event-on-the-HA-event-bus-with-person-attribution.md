## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Why: automations cannot react to who came to the door. TASK-4 parses the access-control log events, but only the latest one is kept in coordinator data and diagnostics; nothing reaches automations. The HA event bus (`<domain>_event`, the pattern of `deconz_event` / `hue_event`) is the standard channel for this, and later device triggers (`device_id`), the access event entity (TASK-5) and the security events (TASK-7) build on it.

**Current behaviour (facts from code, main fbbcd0b).**
- `coordinator.py` `_process_access_event` parses the 10 access events into a frozen `AccessEvent` and stores only `_last_access_event`. `_async_run_log_subscription` processes a whole pull batch and calls `_publish_event_state()` once, so anything that reads "the latest event" sees only the last event of a batch (one card swipe = `CardEntered` + `UserAuthenticated` + `AccessTaken`).
- There is no `hass.bus.async_fire` in `custom_components/` (the only bus use is `async_listen_once` for HA stop in `__init__.py`).
- A ring is counted in two places: the call-event branch of `_process_log_event` (`if not self._ring_detected: self._ring_count += 1`) and `_process_key_pressed_event`. `event.py` `_handle_coordinator_update` builds the `ring` attributes (`called_peer`, `button` from TASK-77, `caller_name`, `caller_number`) inline.
- `__init__.py` `async_setup_entry` starts the log listener before `async_forward_entry_setups`, so the device can be missing from the device registry for the very first events.

**Evidence (2N HTTP API manual, 5.10.1 api log caps, https://wiki.2n.com/hip/hapi/latest/en/5-prehled-funkci-http-api/5-10-api-log/5-10-1-api-log-caps, checked 2026-11-01).** Permanent / conditioned parameters: `CardEntered` "reader, uid, valid" / "ap, session, direction, uuid"; `CodeEntered` "code, valid" / "ap, session, direction, input, type, uuid, reason"; `MobKeyEntered` "action, authid, valid" / "ap, session, direction, uuid"; `FingerEntered` "valid" / "ap, session, direction, uuid"; `UserAuthenticated` "ap, session, name" / "uuid, apbBroken"; `UserRejected` "ap, session, name" / "uuid, reason"; `AccessTaken` "ap, session"; `AccessBlocked` "ap, state"; `AccessLimited` "ap, type, state"; `ApiAccessRequested` "ap, valid" / "session, uuid". So only `UserAuthenticated` and `UserRejected` always carry the user name from the device; for the other events the name comes from the TASK-4 dir/query cache and can be unknown. Not verified: no access event has been captured on the E2E intercom yet; the parameter names come from the manual and the TASK-4 parser.

**Expected behaviour (design decisions, Claude 2026-11-01).**
- D1. Event name `2n_intercom_event` (`DOMAIN + "_event"`).
- D2. One bus event per accepted log event, fired when the event is parsed, in device order. An event the parser rejects fires nothing.
- D3. `type` values: `ring`; `card_entered` (CardEntered), `code_entered` (CodeEntered), `mobile_key_entered` (MobKeyEntered), `fingerprint_entered` (FingerEntered), `user_authenticated` (UserAuthenticated), `user_rejected` (UserRejected), `access_taken` (AccessTaken), `access_blocked` (AccessBlocked), `access_limited` (AccessLimited), `api_access_requested` (ApiAccessRequested).
- D4. Every payload: `device_id`, `config_entry_id`, `type`, `timestamp` (ISO 8601, UTC). Access payload: always all fields of `AccessEvent.as_dict()` except `event_type` (`credential_type`, `access_point`, `direction`, `granted`, `reason`, `state`, `user_uuid`, `user_name`, `session`), `null` when unknown, so `event_data` triggers and templates see a fixed schema. Ring payload: the same attributes the doorbell event entity puts on its `ring` event (one shared helper), absent when unknown, exactly like the entity.
- D5. Never in a payload or a log line: `code`, `uid`, `authid`, `reader` or any raw param. No user name or uuid in log lines.
- D6. A bus `ring` is fired for every counted ring, with the same rules as the doorbell entity (TASK-31: calls into the intercom never ring; `called_id` filter; one ring per press; `ring_on_keypress`), also when the doorbell entity is disabled.
- D7. Not fired: MotionDetected, SwitchStateChanged, InputChanged, OutputChanged, RegistrationStateChanged, ConfigurationChanged, CapabilitiesChanged, DeviceState, DirectoryChanged, KeyPressed that does not ring. Security events are TASK-7.
- D8. `user_name` is best effort: the event is fired at once and never delayed or fired again when a later directory refresh back-fills the name. The README tells users to match on `user_uuid`, or on `user_authenticated`, which always has the name.
- D9. Diagnostics get an `event_bus` section (event name, the types this entry can fire, a count per fired type) so E2E and the tester can see the channel without a physical press.

Out of scope: device triggers, the access event entity (TASK-5), security events (TASK-7), `apbBroken`, user attribution for `AccessTaken`, logbook descriptions, CHANGELOG/version (release task).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Every access event that `_process_access_event` accepts fires exactly one `2n_intercom_event` with the D3 `type` (all 10 types tested); replaying `CardEntered`, `UserAuthenticated` and `AccessTaken` in one pull batch fires three bus events in that order [unit]
- [ ] #2 The access payload has exactly the keys `device_id`, `config_entry_id`, `type`, `timestamp`, `credential_type`, `access_point`, `direction`, `granted`, `reason`, `state`, `user_uuid`, `user_name`, `session`; unknown values are `null`, values equal the parsed `AccessEvent`, and `timestamp` is a tz-aware ISO 8601 string from `utcTime` [unit]
- [ ] #3 `user_name` comes from the event `name` for `user_authenticated` / `user_rejected` and from the dir/query cache for the other types; it is `null` when unknown, and a later directory back-fill does not fire the event again [unit]
- [ ] #4 No payload contains `code`, `uid`, `authid` or `reader`, nor their values: `CodeEntered` with a code, `CardEntered` with a uid and `MobKeyEntered` with an authid are tested; no new log line contains a user name or uuid [unit]
- [ ] #5 Rejected access events (params not a dict, no `valid`, unknown `state`) fire no bus event and the next event is still processed; `MotionDetected`, `SwitchStateChanged`, `InputChanged`, `OutputChanged`, `RegistrationStateChanged`, `ConfigurationChanged`, `CapabilitiesChanged`, `DeviceState`, `DirectoryChanged` and a `KeyPressed` that does not ring fire none [unit]
- [ ] #6 Each counted ring fires one `type: ring` event whose extra keys equal the doorbell entity ring attributes for the same ring (shared helper, compared in a test); `CallStateChanged` + `CallSessionStateChanged` of one press fire one; a call into the intercom and a `called_id`-filtered ring fire none; `ring_on_keypress` with `%1` fires one; the bus ring fires also when the doorbell entity is disabled [unit]
- [ ] #7 `device_id` is the id of the device registry entry with identifier `(2n_intercom, entry_id)`, `null` while that device is not registered yet and resolved on a later event; `config_entry_id` is the entry id [unit]
- [ ] #8 Diagnostics have an `event_bus` section: `event` = `2n_intercom_event`, `types` = the types this entry can fire, derived from the subscribed log events, and `fired` = a count per type since setup; it contains no user name, uuid or other user data [unit]
- [ ] #9 A new E2E test in `e2e/tests/test_50_access_control.py` checks HA diagnostics `event_bus.types` ⇄ device `/api/log/caps` (`ring` when `CallStateChanged` or `CallSessionStateChanged` is in caps, plus the mapped access types in caps), with its own copy of the mapping; it is read-only and the rest of the E2E suite stays green [e2e]
- [ ] #10 `README.md` has the subsection "Event bus: `2n_intercom_event`" under Automation Examples with the type table, the payload table, name sources, what is never included, the recorder note and two YAML examples (person arrives via `user_authenticated`; wrong PIN via `code_entered` with `granted: false`); `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` mention the bus event; no CHANGELOG or version change (checked in the PR diff) [unit]
- [ ] #11 Unit suite, `validate.py` and `py_compile` pass; existing ring, keypress, access-parsing, doorbell entity and subscription tests pass unchanged [unit]
- [ ] #12 After the merge, the staging HA system log shows no error from `2n_intercom` after a restart, and diagnostics show `event_bus` with types that match the device and integer counts [tester]
- [ ] #13 Jan listens to `2n_intercom_event` in Developer tools → Events: one call-button press gives one `ring` event with the device_id of the intercom device, a call from My2N into the intercom gives none, a valid credential the intercom supports gives `granted: true` and the user name on `user_authenticated`, and a wrong PIN gives `code_entered` with `granted: false` and no code (the valid credential opens the door: relay) [jan]

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. `const.py`: `EVENT_2N_INTERCOM = f"{DOMAIN}_event"`, `BUS_EVENT_RING = "ring"`, `ACCESS_BUS_EVENT_TYPES: dict[str, str]` mapping each name in `ACCESS_LOG_EVENTS` to its D3 type (keep `ACCESS_LOG_EVENTS` unchanged; a unit test asserts both have the same keys).
2. `coordinator.py`, device id: `self._device_id: str | None = None`. Method `_resolve_device_id()`: return the cached id; else, with `self.config_entry`, import `homeassistant.helpers.device_registry` locally (same pattern as `get_device_info`) and use `async_get(self.hass).async_get_device(identifiers={(DOMAIN, entry_id)})`; cache only a found id; return `None` otherwise. Do not wrap it in a broad `except`; add a small `device_registry` stub to `tests/_stubs.py` instead.
3. `coordinator.py`, firing: `self._bus_events_fired: dict[str, int] = {}`. Method `_fire_bus_event(event_type: str, timestamp: datetime, data: dict[str, Any])` builds `{"device_id": ..., "config_entry_id": entry_id or None, "type": event_type, "timestamp": timestamp.isoformat(), **data}`, calls `self.hass.bus.async_fire(EVENT_2N_INTERCOM, payload)` and increments the counter. At most one debug line with the type only (no user data).
4. `coordinator.py`, access: at the end of `_process_access_event`, after `self._last_access_event = AccessEvent(...)`, fire `ACCESS_BUS_EVENT_TYPES[event_name]` with `as_dict()` minus `event_type` and `timestamp` (the timestamp goes in as the argument). Return values and `_last_access_event` stay as they are. `_async_refresh_directory_names` back-fill must not fire anything.
5. `coordinator.py`, ring: new public method `ring_event_attributes() -> dict[str, Any]` that returns what `event.py` builds today (`called_peer`, `button` (TASK-77, from `last_ring_button`), `caller_name`, `caller_number`, each only when known). Call branch of `_process_log_event`: remember `new_ring = not self._ring_detected` before the count, and fire `BUS_EVENT_RING` with `self._last_ring_time` and `ring_event_attributes()` after `self._last_ring_time` is set, only when `new_ring`. `_process_key_pressed_event`: fire after `self._last_ring_time` is set. No other change to ring detection.
6. `coordinator.py`, properties: `bus_event_types` (sorted list: `ring` when `CallStateChanged`, `CallSessionStateChanged` or `KeyPressed` is in `_subscribed_log_events`, plus the mapped types of the subscribed access events) and `bus_events_fired` (copy of the counter).
7. `event.py`: `_handle_coordinator_update` uses `coordinator.ring_event_attributes()`; behaviour unchanged.
8. `diagnostics.py`: section `event_bus` = `{"event": EVENT_2N_INTERCOM, "types": coordinator.bus_event_types, "fired": coordinator.bus_events_fired}`.
9. Unit tests: `tests/test_coordinator_access.py` (one bus event per accepted access event and type, batch order, fixed key set, `null`s, timestamp from `utcTime`, name sources incl. no re-fire on back-fill, secrets absent, rejected/non-user-facing events fire nothing, device_id cached / `None` before registration); `tests/test_coordinator.py` and `tests/test_coordinator_keypress.py` (one bus ring per press, none for incoming calls or `called_id`-filtered rings, keypress ring, ring payload == entity ring attributes for the same ring, using a press with `info="2"` so `button` is compared too); `tests/test_event.py` (entity attributes unchanged via the helper); `tests/test_diagnostics.py` (`event_bus` section, no user data). Add `bus.async_fire` recording to the `_Hass` test helpers.
10. E2E: new test in `e2e/tests/test_50_access_control.py`: skip when diagnostics have no `event_bus`; expected types from `twon.log_caps()` with a local copy of the mapping (`ring` when `CallStateChanged` or `CallSessionStateChanged` is in caps; `KeyPressed` is off by default) == diagnostics `event_bus.types`; `fired` values are ints. Read-only, no relay, no call.
11. Docs: `README.md` new subsection under "Automation Examples": "Event bus: `2n_intercom_event`" with the D3 type table, the D4 payload table, name sources (D8), what is never included (D5), that HA's recorder stores the events incl. user names, and two YAML examples (`platform: event`, `event_type: 2n_intercom_event`, `event_data: {type: user_authenticated, user_name: ...}`; `event_data: {type: code_entered, granted: false}`); one line in the "Access control" feature bullet. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section "2. Události": the bus event step. `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` event -> action table: the bus type per access event and for the ring.

Must not change: ring detection rules and counting (TASK-31, the TASK-77 button logic, `called_id`, one ring per press, `KEYPRESS_RING_HOLD`), the snapshot, the TASK-4 parsing and `AccessEvent`, the subscribed event list, the doorbell entity behaviour, `entry.data`/`entry.options`, translations (no new strings needed). One bad event must never break the subscription.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
2026-10-24 (Jan): in scope of v1.6.0 (access and security events in automations are the main feature of the version). Not ready yet: needs analysis (payload schema and event types checked against log events from the E2E intercom and the 2N Logged Events manual), implementation plan and verifier tags on every criterion before it is assigned to @copilot. Order: TASK-6, then TASK-5 and TASK-7.

2026-11-01 (Claude): analysis done (code on main fbbcd0b, 2N manual 5.10.1 api log caps). Payload schema and type names are decisions D1-D9 in the description; verifier tags on every criterion. Ready for @copilot. TASK-77 is on main: the ring attributes incl. `button` move into the coordinator helper `ring_event_attributes()`, used by both the doorbell entity and the bus ring event (AC #6).
