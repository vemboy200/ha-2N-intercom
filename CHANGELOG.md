# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Ring on incoming call is now optional
- New `ring_on_call` option (initial setup + options flow, default **on**) gates whether `CallStateChanged`/`CallSessionStateChanged` events set the doorbell ring, independent of `ring_on_keypress`. Disable it when something other than a physical button press can place a call to the device (e.g. an intercom/page-through call from a home automation system) — the separate Call state sensor keeps tracking calls either way, and a call ending no longer clears a ring set by an unrelated button press
- Fixes a false-positive doorbell ring reported against a Control4-integrated DS2 door station, where the home automation system placing a call into the intercom was indistinguishable from a real button press

### Coordinator tolerates transient auth errors before reauth
- A single stale-nonce `401` no longer immediately raises `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` and forces the user to reopen the config flow — the device recovers on the next request once the digest auth session refreshes its nonce
- `NUM_AUTH_ERRORS = 3` consecutive auth errors are now tolerated (raising `UpdateFailed` in the meantime) before declaring an actual auth failure; the counter resets on the next successful update

### Options flow reorganized into an independent-category menu
- Options now open on a menu (Doorbell / Camera / Relays) instead of a forced linear wizard — pick a category and it saves and closes on its own, no need to walk through the others
- Removed the "Device" category and its duplicate `name` field — renaming now goes through Home Assistant's own device dialog instead of a field that shadowed it; the camera toggle moved into the Camera step, which is always offered since it's also where the camera gets turned back on
- Multi-relay overrides collapsed onto a single page (one collapsible section per relay) instead of a separate wizard page per relay
- Removed the user-configurable backup-polling interval (`scan_interval`) — this is a local-push integration (event subscription over `/api/log/*`); the safety-net poll is now a fixed, non-configurable 60 s, matching `quality_scale.yaml`'s `appropriate-polling` rule and the field's own long-standing "backup only" description

### Ring on button press (KeyPressed events)
- The doorbell binary sensor now also triggers on the device's `KeyPressed` log event — a physical button press rings even when it never becomes a SIP call. Devices with an empty directory (no call destination configured for the button) previously produced no ring at all, because ring detection was exclusively call-state driven
- New `ring_on_keypress` option (initial setup + options flow, default **on**) controls the behavior; disable it to keep strictly call-based ring detection (for example on multi-button installs that rely on the `called_id` peer filter, which cannot apply to button presses)
- `KeyPressed` is only added to the log subscription when the option is enabled
- The ring pulse now clears itself via a one-shot timer — a keypress ring has no terminal call event to end it, so without the timer the sensor would stay `on` until the next backup poll
- `last_key_pressed` exposed as an extra state attribute on the doorbell entity
- Translations updated (EN, CS, DE)

## 1.3.1 - 2026-04-12

### Documentation sync and quality scale
- Updated README.md, INSTALLATION.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, and validate.py to reflect the event-driven subscription model (ring detection is exclusively event-driven with no polling fallback, backup polling is a low-frequency safety net at 60 s default)
- `quality_scale.yaml`: strict-typing marked `done` (mypy strict clean, pyright clean with framework-level suppressions via `pyrightconfig.json`)
- Added `pyrightconfig.json` to suppress HA-framework-level pyright false positives (`cached_property` override, stub fallback typing) that affect all HA integrations equally
- Stripped vestigial polling ring-detection code from `_async_update_data` — baseline state capture retained for event handlers
- Adopted HA `_attr_*` pattern for all static entity properties, fixing pyright `reportIncompatibleVariableOverride` errors

## 1.3.0 - 2026-04-12

### Motion detection binary sensor
- New `binary_sensor.<intercom>_motion` entity with `device_class=motion`, driven by the device's `MotionDetected` log events (`state: "in"` = motion started, `"out"` = motion ended)
- Motion detection capability is auto-detected via `/api/system/caps` — the sensor is only created when `motionDetection` is `"active,licensed"` on the device
- The log subscription (`/api/log/subscribe`) now includes `MotionDetected` events alongside `CallStateChanged` / `CallSessionStateChanged` when motion detection is available
- `last_motion` timestamp exposed as extra state attribute
- System capabilities (`/api/system/caps`) fetched once during coordinator static cache initialisation
- Diagnostics output includes `system_caps` and `motion_detection` sections
- RTSP probe skipped entirely when `/api/system/caps` reports `rtspServer` as not `"active"` — avoids a TCP+Digest handshake timeout on devices without the RTSP license
- Translations updated (EN, CS) for the new entity

## 1.2.0 - 2026-04-12

### RTSP credentials as separate configuration
- The 2N RTSP server has its own user database, independent of the HTTP API accounts. RTSP credentials are now configured separately in the camera options step (`rtsp_username`, `rtsp_password`) with no fallback to HTTP API credentials
- RTSP probe upgraded from port-reachability check to full Digest authentication handshake (unauthenticated OPTIONS → 401 challenge → authenticated OPTIONS) — the integration no longer marks RTSP as "available" when credentials are wrong
- Special characters in RTSP credentials are URL-encoded in the stream URL
- Without RTSP credentials configured, the integration skips RTSP entirely and falls back to MJPEG
- RTSP credentials are redacted in diagnostics output
- Translations updated (EN, CS) with labels and descriptions for the new fields

## 1.1.0 - 2026-04-11

### HA 2026.4+ compliance
- Imported `homeassistant.components.persistent_notification` API (`hass.components.X` accessor was removed in HA 2025.1)
- `OptionsFlow` no longer stores `config_entry`; uses `self.config_entry` from the framework
- `DataUpdateCoordinator` constructed with the `config_entry` kwarg so HA tags traces with the entry
- Manifest: `requirements: []`, `iot_class: local_push`, `integration_type: device`
- HACS metadata bumped to `homeassistant: 2026.4.0`

### Camera
- Switched from `Camera + stream_source + ffmpeg` to `homeassistant.components.mjpeg.MjpegCamera`
- Credentials are passed to `MjpegCamera` separately and **never** appear in the URL exposed to logs, diagnostics, or dashboards
- Camera transport (RTSP / MJPEG / public-MJPEG) is resolved **once** at coordinator setup; the entity reads `coordinator.camera_transport_info` instead of probing on every property access

### Event handling and call lifecycle
- Push-driven log subscription via `/api/log/subscribe` + `/api/log/pull` + `/api/log/unsubscribe` with re-subscribe and exponential backoff (capped at ~60 s)
- Polling fallback through `/api/call/status` keeps ringing detection alive when the push channel is degraded
- New `2n_intercom.answer_call` and `2n_intercom.hangup_call` services with `target.config_entry` and a `reason` selector (`normal` / `rejected` / `busy`)
- `sensor.<intercom>_call_state` exposes an `active_session_id` attribute so automations can hang up the exact session they answered
- Hangup logic: only the firmware's idempotent `code 14 + "session not found"` response is treated as success — every other rejection (including `code 14 + "Unsupported Content-Type"`) is logged as a real failure
- Centralised device-error parsing across the entire client: any non-success response surfaces as a WARNING with `code` / `description` / `param`; only the idempotent hangup case stays at DEBUG

### Diagnostics and real-state entities
- `sensor.<intercom>_sip_registration` — derived from `/api/phone/status`
- `sensor.<intercom>_call_state` — exposes `active_session_id`
- `binary_sensor.<intercom>_input_1` — real `/api/io/status` input state
- `binary_sensor.<intercom>_relay_1_active` — real cached `/api/switch/status` relay state
- Lock fallback `is_locked` prefers cached `switch/status` for relay 1 and only falls back to optimistic state when `switch/caps` confirms relay 1 doesn't exist

### Configuration flows
- Reauth flow (`async_step_reauth`) — credential rejection raises `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` instead of looping on `ConfigEntryNotReady`
- Reconfigure flow (`async_step_reconfigure`) — change host/port/protocol/credentials/SSL without removing the entry (HA 2024.10+)

### Performance / KISS
- Static caps (`switch/caps`, `io/caps`, camera transport) fetched **once** at setup, not refetched per poll — only `switch/status`, `io/status`, `phone/status`, and the `call/status` fallback poll on the 5-second interval
- Shared `TwoNIntercomEntity` base class — `device_info`, `available`, and `_attr_has_entity_name` deduplicated across every platform
- Snapshot caching collapsed into a single layer at the coordinator
- Removed dead `PLATFORMS` constant; `_get_platforms()` now returns `Platform` enum members
- Dropped legacy `BinarySensorDeviceClass.DOORBELL` `getattr` fallback
- `services.yaml` gained per-service `target.config_entry` and a `reason` selector
