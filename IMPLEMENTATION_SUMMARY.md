# Implementation Summary: 2N Intercom Integration

## Overview

This integration drives a 2N IP Intercom from Home Assistant. It started as a basic lock entity, was redesigned around `DataUpdateCoordinator`, and was hardened against the 2N HTTP API 2.50 LTS for the **2N IP Verso** (firmware `2.50.0.76.2`) — a single-family-house deployment with no RTSP licence.

The remediation pass that produced the current shape added MJPEG-first live view, event-driven state handling, real-state status entities, answer/hangup services, reauth + reconfigure flows, and HA 2026.4+ compliance. The current version (`1.3.1`) extends event subscriptions to all state types (switch, IO, phone, config) and makes polling a low-frequency safety net.

## What is implemented

### 1. Core architecture

- `api.py` — async aiohttp client with **dual auth**: `DigestAuthMiddleware(preemptive=False)` answers Digest challenges automatically and falls back to Basic when the device returns `401 + WWW-Authenticate: Basic`. The 2N firmware exposes a per-service-group auth setting in the device web UI, so the same client transparently handles whatever combination of None/Basic/Digest the operator has configured
- `coordinator.py` — `DataUpdateCoordinator` with status polling, static-caps caching, and a background **log subscription loop** with re-subscribe + exponential backoff
- `entity.py` — shared `TwoNIntercomEntity` base class providing `device_info`, `available`, and `_attr_has_entity_name` for every platform
- `__init__.py` — entry setup, log-listener lifecycle, service registration

### 2. Configuration system

`config_flow.py` provides:

- **User flow** — two-step setup (connection → device), with relay overrides configured later in the options flow
- **Reauth flow** — auto-triggered when the device starts rejecting credentials (raises `ConfigEntryAuthFailed`, surfaces a notification, walks the user through re-entering the password)
- **Reconfigure flow** — HA 2024.10+ flow for changing host/port/protocol/credentials/SSL without removing the entry
- **Options flow** — change device features and per-relay settings post-setup

Validation happens against `system/info` so credential mistakes fail at the form layer instead of mid-poll.

### 3. Platform implementations

#### Camera (`camera.py`)

- Inherits from `CoordinatorEntity` **and** `homeassistant.components.mjpeg.MjpegCamera`
- Native MJPEG live view through `/api/camera/snapshot?fps=<n>` — no ffmpeg, no HLS round-trip
- JPEG snapshot via `coordinator.async_get_snapshot()` (single-layer cache; the duplicated entity-level cache was removed)
- **Credentials never embedded in URLs** — `MjpegCamera` receives `username`/`password` separately
- RTSP returned from `stream_source()` only when the device exposes the RTSP server licence
- Camera transport (RTSP vs MJPEG vs MJPEG-public) is resolved **once** at coordinator setup; the entity reads `coordinator.camera_transport_info` instead of probing on every property access

#### Binary sensors (`binary_sensor.py`)

- `TwoNIntercomDoorbell` — event-driven ring detection from the log subscription (`CallStateChanged` / `CallSessionStateChanged`). Caller name/number/button + last ring timestamp attributes. Device class `OCCUPANCY` (HomeKit doorbell tile is provided by the linked-camera-accessory pattern, not the binary-sensor class). Ring detection is exclusively event-driven; the backup poll does not set ring state
- `TwoNIntercomInput1Sensor` — real `io/status` input 1 state
- `TwoNIntercomRelay1ActiveSensor` — real cached `switch/status` relay 1 active flag

#### Diagnostic sensors (`sensor.py`)

- `TwoNIntercomSipRegistrationStatusSensor` — derived from `phone/status`, exposes `registered_accounts` count attribute
- `TwoNIntercomCallStateSensor` — derived from coordinator's `call_state`, exposes `active_session_id` attribute. **This is the attribute downstream automations use to terminate the exact session they answered.**

#### Switch (`switch.py`)

- Momentary relay control for door-type relays
- Self-resets after the configured pulse duration
- One entity per configured relay

#### Cover (`cover.py`)

- Garage-door-opener style control for gate-type relays
- Optimistic open/close with configurable duration (the IP Verso has no gate-position feedback)

### 4. 2N API endpoints in use

The auth scheme for each endpoint is determined by the 2N device's web-UI **Services → HTTP API** settings (per service group). The integration negotiates Basic vs Digest per request — see the **Architecture** section above.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/api/system/info` | Device identity, credential validation |
| `/api/call/status` | Baseline call state (safety-net poll) |
| `/api/call/answer`, `/api/call/hangup` | Service backends |
| `/api/log/subscribe`, `/api/log/pull`, `/api/log/unsubscribe` | Push-driven event channel |
| `/api/log/caps` | Discover supported event names |
| `/api/switch/caps`, `/api/switch/status`, `/api/switch/ctrl` | Relay caps + cached state + control |
| `/api/io/caps`, `/api/io/status` | Input caps + cached state |
| `/api/phone/status` | SIP registration sensor |
| `/api/camera/caps` | Discover MJPEG fps range and resolutions |
| `/api/camera/snapshot` | JPEG snapshot + MJPEG live view (`fps=1..15`) |
| RTSP stream | Optional, only when licensed |

### 5. Services

Registered in `__init__.py` and declared in `services.yaml` with `target.config_entry` and proper selectors:

| Service | Selectors | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `2n_intercom.answer_call` | `config_entry_id`, `session_id` | Answer the active call (or specific session) |
| `2n_intercom.hangup_call` | `config_entry_id`, `session_id`, `reason` (`normal`/`rejected`/`busy`) | Hang up the active call (or specific session) |

### 6. HomeKit integration

- Camera + linked doorbell sensor → **Video Doorbell** accessory in HomeKit
- Door relay switch → Switch accessory
- Gate relay cover → **Garage Door Opener** accessory

See [HOMEKIT_INTEGRATION.md](HOMEKIT_INTEGRATION.md) for the YAML link snippet that's still needed for the doorbell tile.

### 7. Translations

- English (`en.json`)
- German (`de.json`)
- Czech (`cs.json`)

Both translations cover all config / options / reauth / reconfigure / abort / progress strings, and the new `services` section (`answer_call` and `hangup_call`).

### 8. Code quality

- All Python files compile cleanly (`python3 -m py_compile`)
- All JSON files validate
- `validate.py` enforces manifest compliance (`requirements: []`, `iot_class: local_push`, `integration_type: device`, `config_flow: true`, `version` present) and HACS HA min version (`2026.4.x`)
- 442 unit tests passing (`unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` + hand-rolled HA stubs, no `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`)

## Entity summary

### Per configuration

**Camera + doorbell, default relays:**
- `camera.<name>_camera`
- `binary_sensor.<name>_doorbell`
- `binary_sensor.<name>_input_1`
- `binary_sensor.<name>_relay_1_active`
- `sensor.<name>_sip_registration`
- `sensor.<name>_call_state`
- `switch.<name>_relay_N` (one per auto-discovered door-type relay)

**+ 1 door + 1 gate relay:**
- Add `cover.<name>_<gate_relay_name>`

**Maximum (4 relays):**
- Camera, doorbell, input/relay-active binary sensors, both diagnostic sensors, plus up to 4 switch and/or cover entities

## Configuration flow

1. **Add integration** → "2N Intercom"
2. **Connection step** → host, username, password (protocol and port are auto-detected; validated against `system/info`)
3. **Device step** → name, camera, doorbell, optional ringing peer
4. **Done** → entities created, relays auto-discovered, log listener starts, services available
5. **Options flow** (post-setup) → relay overrides (name, type, pulse), camera transport, polling interval

If credentials later become invalid, HA automatically opens the **reauth** flow. To change connection details without removing the entry, use the **reconfigure** flow from the integration's overflow menu.

## Technical highlights

### Async / I/O

- All HTTP I/O is async via aiohttp
- Single coordinator owns polling, caching, and the log subscription loop
- Static caps (`switch/caps`, `io/caps`, camera transport) are fetched **once** at setup, not on every poll
- Events are the primary data path; the backup poll (default 60 s) refreshes all status endpoints as a safety net

### Error handling and resilience

- `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` on credential rejection → reauth flow
- Persistent notification API uses the imported module (the legacy `hass.components.X` accessor was removed in HA 2025.1)
- Log listener loop catches subscribe failures and re-subscribes with exponential backoff (capped at ~60 s)
- On subscription reconnect, a full baseline refresh closes any gap from missed events
- Coordinator constructed with `config_entry=` so HA tags traces with the entry

### Performance

- Snapshot caching at the coordinator (single layer)
- Static caps cached once, not refetched per poll
- Event-driven state for all entity types (no polling latency for real-time updates)
- `MjpegCamera` serves frames natively to the HA frontend — no ffmpeg / HLS

### Compliance with HA 2026.4+

- Imported `homeassistant.components.persistent_notification` API
- OptionsFlow does not store `config_entry` (uses `self.config_entry` from the framework)
- `DataUpdateCoordinator` constructed with the `config_entry` kwarg
- `manifest.json`: `requirements: []`, `iot_class: local_push`, `integration_type: device`, `version: 1.3.1`
- `hacs.json`: `homeassistant: 2026.4.0`

## What's intentionally **not** implemented

These belong outside the fork or to a separate licence:

- Two-way audio
- Multi-tenant directory UX, keypad workflow, lift control
- License-dependent endpoints (Automation API, Audio Test, NFC, Noise Detection, SMTP, FTP, SNMP, TR069)
- The downstream HA automation that converts the entities into mobile actionable notifications + KNX door opening — that lives in the consuming HA configuration, not in the integration

## Breaking changes

### From 1.0.x → 1.3.1

- Camera entity is now backed by `MjpegCamera` — credentials are no longer embedded in stream URLs. Anything reading the previous credential-leaking URL out of HA logs/diagnostics needs to be updated; the camera entity itself works the same in dashboards and HomeKit
- Auth failures now raise `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` instead of looping on `ConfigEntryNotReady` + persistent notification — you'll see a reauth notification instead
- New shared `TwoNIntercomEntity` base — third-party patches that subclassed individual platform entities for `device_info` may need to drop their override

No data-model breakage; existing config entries load unchanged.

## Testing

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t tests   # 442/442
python3 validate.py                               # all green
python3 -m py_compile custom_components/2n_intercom/*.py
```

End-to-end live verification is done with the standalone scripts under the upstream working tree (e.g. `verify_2n_hangup_live.py`, `verify_door_open_hangup.py`) — they hit a real device, drive a doorbell ring via `/api/sim/keypress`, and validate the full ring → answer → hangup loop against HA.

## Statistics (as of 1.3.1)

- **Platforms:** 5 (camera, binary_sensor, sensor, switch, cover)
- **APIs:** 11 endpoint families (auth scheme determined by device per service group)
- **Services:** 2 (`answer_call`, `hangup_call`)
- **Languages:** 3 (English, German, Czech)
- **Tests:** 442 unit tests
- **HA target:** 2026.4.0+

## Conclusion

The integration is feature-complete for the single-family-house IP Verso baseline: native MJPEG live view, event-driven state updates (ring, switch, IO, phone, config) with backup polling safety net, real-state status entities, answer/hangup services, reauth + reconfigure flows, and HA 2026.4+ compliance — all without ffmpeg in the camera path and without leaking credentials into logs.
