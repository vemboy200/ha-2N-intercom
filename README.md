# ha-2N-intercom

Home Assistant custom integration for 2N IP Intercom systems with camera, doorbell, relay, call control, and HomeKit support.

## Supported Devices

| Device | Firmware | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2N IP Verso** | 2.50.0.76.2 | **Verified** | Tested with and without RTSP license. Primary development target. |
| **2N IP Verso 2.0** | 2.50.x | **Expected to work** | Same API as Verso; untested in this fork |
| **2N IP Solo** | 2.50.x | **Expected to work** | Single-button variant; same HTTP API family |
| **2N IP Base** | 2.50.x | **Expected to work** | Same HTTP API family |
| **2N IP Style** | 2.50.x | **Expected to work** | Same HTTP API family |
| **2N IP Force** | 2.50.x | **Expected to work** | Same HTTP API family |
| **2N IP Safety** | 2.50.x | **Untested** | Same API but may lack camera |
| **2N IP Audio** | 2.50.x | **Untested** | No camera module |
| Older 2N devices | < 2.40 | **Not supported** | Different API surface |
| Non-2N intercoms | — | **Not supported** | 2N HTTP API only |

"Expected to work" means the device uses the same `/api/` HTTP API family as the verified target and should function correctly, but has not been tested by the maintainers. If you run one of these devices and can confirm or deny, please open an issue.

## Features

### Camera
- **JPEG snapshot** via `/api/camera/snapshot`
- **Native MJPEG live view** via `/api/camera/snapshot?...&fps=<n>` — served through Home Assistant's `MjpegCamera`, no ffmpeg/HLS round-trip
- **RTSP stream source** when the device exposes it — requires separate RTSP credentials configured in the options flow (the 2N RTSP server has its own user database independent of the HTTP API accounts)
- **Credentials are passed to `MjpegCamera` separately** — they never appear in the URL exposed to logs, diagnostics, or dashboards
- HomeKit-compatible video doorbell

### Doorbell and call lifecycle
- **Event-driven ring detection** via `/api/log/subscribe` + `/api/log/pull` background loop with automatic re-subscribe and exponential backoff
- **Event-driven state updates** for switches, IO, SIP registration, and device config changes via the same subscription channel
- Binary sensor with caller name/number/button attributes
- **`2n_intercom.answer_call`** and **`2n_intercom.hangup_call`** services that target a config entry and (optionally) a specific session id, with `reason` selector (`normal`/`rejected`/`busy`)
- Diagnostic sensors: SIP registration status, call state with `active_session_id` attribute

### Door / Gate / Relay control
- **Switch** entities for door relays (momentary)
- **Cover** entities for gate relays (garage-door style)
- Relays auto-discovered from `/api/switch/caps` — configurable pulse duration and per-relay name via options flow
- Relay/input states are read from the device (`switch/status`, `io/status`), not optimistic
- HomeKit accessory mapping per relay type

### Configuration
- UI-driven two-step setup (connection → device). Protocol and port are auto-detected (HTTPS:443 first, then HTTP:80)
- **Reauth flow** — when credentials are rejected the integration raises `ConfigEntryAuthFailed`, so HA opens a notification asking the user to re-enter credentials instead of looping on `ConfigEntryNotReady`
- **Reconfigure flow** — change host/port/protocol/credentials/SSL without removing the entry (HA 2024.10+)
- **Options flow** — device features, polling interval, camera transport, and per-relay overrides (name, type, pulse duration). Relays are auto-detected from the device
- Optional "Ringing account (peer)" filter for multi-button setups (`All calls` matches every button)

## Capability Matrix

| Category | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Done** | JPEG snapshot, native MJPEG live view, RTSP stream source (when licensed), event-driven ring/switch/IO/phone/config state, backup polling safety net, relay switch/cover control with real device state, SIP/call diagnostic sensors, answer/hangup services, reauth and reconfigure flows, HomeKit bridge mapping | All verified against 2N IP Verso 2.50.0.76.2 |
| **Out of fork scope** | Two-way audio, multi-tenant directory UX, keypad workflow, lift control, mass-notify | Not needed for a single-family-house deployment |
| **License-dependent** | Automation API, Audio Test, NFC, Noise Detection, SMTP, FTP, SNMP, TR069, Lift Control | Only available when the device license exposes them; not planned in this fork |

### Camera Support Baseline

Verified on a 2N IP Verso with firmware `2.50.0.76.2`:

- RTSP server license: `NO`
- JPEG snapshot works without `fps`
- MJPEG works via `/api/camera/snapshot?...&fps=<n>` over both HTTP and HTTPS
- Valid `fps` values are **`1..15`** (`fps >= 16` returns API error code `12`)
- Resolutions are taken from `camera/caps`. Observed values include
  `176x144`, `320x240`, `352x288`, `640x480`, `800x600`, `1280x960`, `160x120`, `352x272`, `480x272`, `1024x600`, `1280x720`, `640x360`

Helper: [`api.validate_mjpeg_fps`](custom_components/2n_intercom/api.py).

### Authentication

The 2N HTTP API exposes a **per-service-group** authentication setting in the device web UI under **Services → HTTP API**. Each service group (Camera, Switch, I/O, Phone, Call, Log, …) can be set to **None / Basic / Digest** independently, so a single account can end up answering some endpoint families with Basic and others with Digest depending on how the operator has configured the device.

The integration handles every combination transparently:

- The HTTP client uses `aiohttp`'s `DigestAuthMiddleware` (with `preemptive=False`) so it answers Digest challenges automatically.
- When the device answers a request with `401 + WWW-Authenticate: Basic`, the client retries the same request with Basic auth.

The same username and password must work for every service group the integration touches. **Don't try to "simplify" `_async_request`** by hard-coding one scheme — the dual-auth path exists exactly because the device exposes the choice per service group.

#### RTSP authentication

The 2N RTSP server has its **own user database**, completely independent of the HTTP API accounts. RTSP credentials are configured on the device under **Services → Streaming → RTSP Server → User Database**. There is no fallback from HTTP API credentials to RTSP credentials — they are separate systems.

The integration provides optional **RTSP Username** and **RTSP Password** fields in the camera options step. When configured:

- The RTSP probe performs a full Digest authentication handshake (unauthenticated OPTIONS → 401 challenge → authenticated OPTIONS) to validate that the credentials actually work before marking RTSP as available.
- RTSP URLs embed the credentials for the HA stream worker (`rtsp://user:pass@host:554/h264_stream`). Special characters in credentials are URL-encoded.
- Without RTSP credentials, the integration will not attempt RTSP even if the device has a valid RTSP license — it falls back to MJPEG.

## Architecture

- **DataUpdateCoordinator** centralises polling, caching, and the background log listener
- **MJPEG-first camera** built on `homeassistant.components.mjpeg.MjpegCamera`
- **Event-driven + backup polling** — real-time state via log subscriptions; low-frequency polling (default 60 s) as a safety net
- **`TwoNIntercomEntity`** base class shared by all platforms — single source for `device_info`, `available`, and `_attr_has_entity_name`
- Platform-based: `camera`, `binary_sensor`, `switch`, `cover`, `sensor`

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS → Integrations
2. Three-dot menu → Custom repositories
3. Add `https://github.com/vemboy200/ha-2N-intercom` as an integration
4. Install **2N Intercom**
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual installation

1. Copy `custom_components/2n_intercom` into your HA `config/custom_components/`
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Settings → Devices & Services → **+ Add Integration** → 2N Intercom

### Removing the integration

1. Settings → Devices & Services → 2N Intercom
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) on the integration card → **Delete**
3. Confirm the removal

All entities, devices, and automation references created by this integration are removed immediately. No restart is required. If you installed via HACS, you can also uninstall the repository entry from HACS → Integrations afterwards to stop receiving update notifications.

### Reconfiguring or re-authenticating

- **Reconfigure**: Settings → Devices & Services → 2N Intercom → ⋮ → **Reconfigure**. Lets you change host/port/protocol/credentials without removing the entry.
- **Reauth**: triggered automatically when the device starts rejecting credentials. HA shows a notification — click it to re-enter the password.

## Configuration

### Initial setup

The setup wizard has two steps:

1. **Connection** — host, username, password. Protocol (HTTPS/HTTP) and port (443/80) are auto-detected
2. **Device** — display name, enable camera, and a collapsible **Doorbell** section (enable doorbell, ring on button press, ring on incoming call, ringing account)

Relays are **not** configured during initial setup. The integration auto-discovers enabled relays from the device's `/api/switch/caps` endpoint and creates switch entities automatically. To override relay names, types (door/gate), or pulse durations, open the **Options** flow after setup.

### Initial setup parameters

| Step | Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Connection | `host` | string | *(required)* | IP address or hostname of the intercom |
| Connection | `username` | string | *(required)* | Device API username |
| Connection | `password` | string | *(required)* | Device API password |
| Device | `name` | string | *(auto-detected)* | Display name in Home Assistant |
| Device | `enable_camera` | bool | `true` | Create the camera entity |
| Device → Doorbell | `enable_doorbell` | bool | `true` | Create the doorbell binary sensor |
| Device → Doorbell | `ring_on_keypress` | bool | `true` | Ring on physical button press (`KeyPressed` event), even when the press does not start a SIP call |
| Device → Doorbell | `ring_on_call` | bool | `true` | Ring on an incoming SIP call (`CallStateChanged`/`CallSessionStateChanged`). Disable if something other than a physical button press can place a call to this device (e.g. an intercom/page-through call from a home automation system) — the separate Call state sensor still tracks calls either way |
| Device → Doorbell | `called_id` | string | `All calls` | Ringing account / peer filter. Does not apply to button presses |

### Options flow parameters

After initial setup, open the integration's **Options** (Settings → Devices & Services → 2N Intercom → **Configure**) to change behavioral settings without removing the entry. Connection settings are changed through the **Reconfigure** flow instead.

Options open on a menu of independent categories — pick one and it saves and closes immediately, no need to walk through the others. There's no separate "Device" category: renaming the device uses Home Assistant's own device dialog (Settings → Devices & Services → the device itself), not something this integration duplicates.

- **Doorbell** — doorbell toggle, ring-on-button-press, ring-on-incoming-call, ringing account
- **Camera** — camera toggle, live view mode, RTSP credentials, MJPEG resolution/fps, camera source. Always offered, since it's also where the camera gets turned on
- **Relays** *(only offered when the device has relays)* — one collapsible section per auto-detected relay: name, device type (door/gate), pulse duration

There is no configurable polling interval — this is a local-push integration (event subscription over `/api/log/*`); the backup poll (see below) runs on a fixed, non-configurable interval.

| Step | Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Doorbell | `enable_doorbell` | bool | `true` | Toggle doorbell entity |
| Doorbell | `ring_on_keypress` | bool | `true` | Ring on physical button press (`KeyPressed` event), even when the press does not start a SIP call. The `called_id` filter does not apply to button presses |
| Doorbell | `ring_on_call` | bool | `true` | Ring on an incoming SIP call. Disable to rely solely on button presses when something else (e.g. Control4) can also place calls to this device |
| Doorbell | `called_id` | string | `All calls` | Ringing account / peer filter |
| Camera | `enable_camera` | bool | `true` | Toggle camera entity |
| Camera | `live_view_mode` | `auto` \| `rtsp` \| `mjpeg` \| `jpeg_only` | `auto` | Camera live view transport. `auto` picks RTSP if licensed and RTSP credentials are set, then MJPEG, then snapshots |
| Camera | `rtsp_username` | string | *(empty)* | RTSP server username (from the 2N RTSP user database, **not** the HTTP API account) |
| Camera | `rtsp_password` | string | *(empty)* | RTSP server password |
| Camera | `camera_source` | `internal` \| `external` | `internal` | Which camera sensor to stream (external = secondary module) |
| Camera | `mjpeg_width` | 160-2592 (px) | 1280 | MJPEG stream width |
| Camera | `mjpeg_height` | 160-2592 (px) | 960 | MJPEG stream height |
| Camera | `mjpeg_fps` | 1-15 | 10 | MJPEG frame rate. Lower values reduce bandwidth |
| Relays | `relay_name` | string | `Relay N` | Display name for this relay |
| Relays | `relay_device_type` | `door` \| `gate` | `door` | Door → switch entity, Gate → cover entity |
| Relays | `relay_pulse_duration` | int (ms) | *(from device)* | How long the relay stays triggered. Default is the device's switchOnDuration |

### Example: single-family house (door + gate)

```
Initial setup:
  Host: 192.0.2.20
  Username: homeassistant
  Password: ****
  → auto-detects HTTPS:443

  Name: Home Intercom
  Camera: yes
  Doorbell: yes

Options flow (after setup):
  Relay 1 → Front Door, door, 2000 ms
  Relay 2 → Driveway Gate, gate, 15000 ms
```

Resulting entities:

- `camera.home_intercom_camera`
- `binary_sensor.home_intercom_doorbell`
- `binary_sensor.home_intercom_input_1` *(real device input)*
- `binary_sensor.home_intercom_relay_1_active` *(real cached relay state)*
- `sensor.home_intercom_sip_registration`
- `sensor.home_intercom_call_state` *(attribute: `active_session_id`)*
- `switch.home_intercom_front_door`
- `cover.home_intercom_driveway_gate`

## Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `2n_intercom.answer_call` | Answer the active call session (or a specific `session_id`) |
| `2n_intercom.hangup_call` | Hang up the active call session (or a specific `session_id`) with optional `reason` (`normal` / `rejected` / `busy`) |

Both services target a config entry. From the UI use the **Target → Integration** picker; from YAML use `data.config_entry_id`. Pair `hangup_call` with `sensor.<intercom>_call_state`'s `active_session_id` attribute to terminate the exact session that triggered an automation.

Example actionable-notification snippet:

```yaml
- service: 2n_intercom.hangup_call
  data:
    session_id: "{{ state_attr('sensor.home_intercom_call_state', 'active_session_id') }}"
    reason: normal
```

## Automation Examples

### Blueprint: Doorbell notification with answer/hangup

A ready-to-use blueprint is included at [`blueprints/doorbell_notification_answer_hangup.yaml`](blueprints/doorbell_notification_answer_hangup.yaml). It sends a mobile notification with a camera snapshot and action buttons to answer or hang up the call when the doorbell rings.

To import:

1. Copy the YAML file into your `config/blueprints/automation/2n_intercom/` directory
2. Reload automations
3. Create a new automation from the blueprint and fill in your entities

### Quick YAML example: open door on doorbell

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Auto-open door on ring"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.home_intercom_doorbell
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.home_intercom_relay_1
```

## 2N API Endpoints Used

The integration negotiates Basic vs Digest per request — see the **Authentication** section above.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/api/system/info` | Device identity |
| `/api/call/status` | Baseline call state (safety-net poll) |
| `/api/call/answer`, `/api/call/hangup` | Service backends |
| `/api/log/subscribe`, `/api/log/pull`, `/api/log/unsubscribe` | Push-driven event stream |
| `/api/switch/caps`, `/api/switch/status`, `/api/switch/ctrl` | Relay control + cached state |
| `/api/io/caps`, `/api/io/status` | Cached input state |
| `/api/phone/status` | SIP registration sensor |
| `/api/camera/caps` | Discover MJPEG capability + resolutions |
| `/api/camera/snapshot` (with/without `fps`) | JPEG snapshot + MJPEG live view |
| RTSP stream | Optional, only when the device licence exposes it |

## Data Updates

The integration uses two data channels:

- **Event subscriptions (primary)** — `/api/log/subscribe` + `/api/log/pull` long-poll loop. Subscribes to `CallStateChanged`, `CallSessionStateChanged`, `SwitchStateChanged`, `InputChanged`, `OutputChanged`, `RegistrationStateChanged`, `ConfigurationChanged`, `CapabilitiesChanged`, `DeviceState`, and (when available) `MotionDetected`. State changes arrive within ~1 second. The listener auto-resubscribes with exponential backoff on failures and forces a full baseline refresh after each reconnect
- **Backup polling (safety net)** — the coordinator polls status endpoints (`switch/status`, `io/status`, `phone/status`, `call/status`, `switch/caps`) on a fixed 60-second interval, not user-configurable. This catches any events missed during subscription gaps but does not perform ring detection — ring detection is exclusively event-driven
- **Static caps** — `switch/caps`, `io/caps`, and camera transport info are fetched once at setup and cached. Switch caps are also refreshed on `ConfigurationChanged` / `CapabilitiesChanged` events and on every poll cycle as a safety net

## Use Cases

- **Video doorbell** — camera snapshot + event-driven ring notification via mobile app
- **Door opening** — trigger relay via switch entity from automations, dashboards, or HomeKit
- **Gate control** — garage-door-style open/close via cover entity
- **Call management** — answer or reject incoming calls from automations using the `answer_call` / `hangup_call` services
- **Multi-button setups** — filter doorbell events by ringing account (peer) to distinguish front door from side entrance
- **HomeKit bridge** — expose camera as video doorbell, relays as switches/garage doors in Apple Home

## Known Limitations

- **No two-way audio** — the HA camera platform does not support bi-directional audio; the doorbell ring triggers notifications but audio is device-side only
- **RTSP requires a separate license** — the 2N RTSP server is a paid feature; without it, only MJPEG streaming is available
- **RTSP credentials are independent** — the RTSP server has its own user database; HTTP API credentials do not work for RTSP
- **No gate position feedback** — the IP Verso has no gate-position sensor; cover entities use optimistic state transitions
- **Single camera source** — only one camera source (internal or external) can be active per config entry
- **Firmware < 2.40 unsupported** — older firmware versions use a different API surface

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect during setup
- Verify IP/port/credentials and protocol; firewall; SSL trust if HTTPS
- The same username and password must be valid for **both** Basic and Digest auth on the device — if the device rejects one of the schemes, every endpoint that uses it will fail. Configure the account under **Services → HTTP API → Account** on the 2N web UI

### Camera entity has no live view
- Confirm `camera/caps` returns `mjpeg.fps_min`/`fps_max` (the integration's transport probe runs once at setup; reload the entry after changing camera caps on the device)
- Open the entity attributes — `live_view_selected_mode` should be `mjpeg`, `mjpeg_available` should be `true`

### RTSP stream not working
- Make sure the RTSP server licence is enabled on the device
- Configure RTSP credentials in the integration's options flow (Settings → Devices & Services → 2N Intercom → Configure → Camera step). The RTSP server has its own user database — HTTP API credentials do **not** work for RTSP
- Create an RTSP user on the device: **Services → Streaming → RTSP Server → User Database**
- The entity attributes should show `rtsp_available: true` and `live_view_selected_mode: rtsp` when RTSP is working
- If RTSP credentials are wrong, the integration logs a warning and falls back to MJPEG

### Doorbell not triggering
- Ring detection is exclusively event-driven via the log subscription — there is no polling fallback for ring events
- Open the integration's diagnostics; the log subscription id should be set
- Press the button and watch HA logs — the event path should flip the binary sensor within ~1 s
- If the subscription is down, the listener retries with exponential backoff (up to ~60 s). Ring events during a subscription gap are lost

### Reauth notification keeps appearing
- Credentials really are wrong, or the device locked the account. Check the 2N web UI under **Services → HTTP API → Account** and re-enter the password through the reauth flow

## Credits

Originally created by [mastalir1980](https://github.com/mastalir1980/ha-2N-intercom) for the Home Assistant community. The HA 2026.4+ remediation, MJPEG-first camera, push-driven event handling, real-state status entities, answer/hangup services, and dual-auth client were built by [savek-cc](https://github.com/savek-cc/ha-2N-intercom).

This fork is maintained by [vemboy200](https://github.com/vemboy200/ha-2N-intercom), building on that work with:
- `ring_on_call` — lets the doorbell ignore incoming SIP calls that aren't real button presses (e.g. an intercom/page-through call from a home automation system), so it can't false-positive on installs where something other than the physical button can call the device
- An options flow reorganized into an independent-category menu (Doorbell / Camera / Relays) — pick one and it saves and closes, no forced linear wizard
- Multi-relay overrides collapsed onto a single page (one section per relay) instead of one page per relay
- Removed the user-configurable backup-polling interval — this is a local-push integration; the safety-net poll is now fixed and non-configurable
